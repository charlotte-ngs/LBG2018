## Error in Algorithm To Compute $A$
In section 6.2.1 of [chapter 6](https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/LBGFS2018/cn/06-gencov.pdf) of the course notes (published on 2018-11-02), there is an error in the formula that computes the diagonal element $(A)_{ii}$


## Corrected Version
The diagonal element $(A)_{ii}$ is computed as

* If both parents $s$ and $d$ of animal $i$ are known then 
    + the diagonal element $(A)_{ii}$ corresponds to: $(A)_{ii} = 1 + F_i = 1 + {1\over 2} (A)_{sd}$ and
