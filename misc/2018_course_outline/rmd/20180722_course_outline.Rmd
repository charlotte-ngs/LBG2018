## Disclaimer
This document describes the plans and the outline of the new course in Livestock Breeding and Genomics (LBG). LBG is a one semester course offered to masters students in agriculture at ETH Zurich.


## Introduction and Background
I am teaching this course for the fourth time now. The topics covered so far were centered around Breeding Value Estimation unsing a BLUP animal model. In most previous versions of the course, we got to that goal right at the end of the course. Usually, most of the semester was taken by trying to explain some prerequisites. Such a course design works like a  `murder case` where the most important thing comes at the end (see Figure \@ref(fig:course-tension-diagram)). This is not a good strategy to design a course. Because it confuses students on what is important for this course and students get tired towards the end of the semester. 

```{r course-tension-diagram, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="../odg", fig.cap="Distribution of Importance in a Course"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "../odg/course-tension-diagram.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/course-tension-diagram.png")
```

The most important topic of a course must be presented right at the beginning of the course. Any pre-requisites or explanaitions can also be moved into the after-math-part of the course. This is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:improved-importance). 

```{r improved-importance, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="../odg", fig.cap="Improved Importance Distribution"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "../odg/improved-importance.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/improved-importance.png")
```



### Conclusion
Hence, this course needs to be re-designed with the aim to have the most important part at the beginning of the course. Pre-requisites are either moved out of the course into non-mandatory extra-hours or are explained on the fly, as we progress through the material of the course. 


## Context
The re-design of LBG has to be viewed in a larger context. The two other courses that I teach during the spring semester do belong to this context. These courses are 

* __Applied Statistical Methods in Animal Sciences__ and 
* __Applied Breeding Value Estimation__

While the re-design of these two courses is not what we want to focus on right now, it is clear that these two courses have similar problems as LBG and the process of re-designing has to be continued for these two courses also.


## New Plan for LBG
Definition and concepts of __Livestock Breeding__ are at the center of this course. We are starting by definition (\@ref(def:lbg)) of __Livestock Breeding__ that is used for this course.

\vspace{3ex}
```{definition, label="lbg", name="Livestock Breeding"}
Livestock Breeding uses tools such as __artificial selection__ and __assortative mating__ to improve future generations with respect to a previously defined __breeding goal__. 
```

The term livestock breeding is based on three other important concepts

1. __breeding goal__
2. __artificial selection__ and 
3. __assortative mating__


### Breeding Goal
Breeding goals are descriptions of what an ideal animal would be for a given livestock breed. Such descriptions can occur in different forms. 

1. Description of phenotypic characteristics of the ideal animal. Such descriptions may often contain combinations of trait values that are impossible to be reached. Such goals are also called _political_ breeding goals. 
2. _Scientific_ breeding goals use mathematical functions to describe what would be desirable changes in the characteristics of our livestock animals. Hence, scientific breeding goals are not based on a given set of properties of an animal, but they allow us to assess the development of an animals properties.

In this course, we will be working with the scientific version of a breeding goal.


### Artificial Selection 
Artificial selection corresponds to the process where animals are selected as parents
