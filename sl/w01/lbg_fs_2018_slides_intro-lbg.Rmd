## Prerequisites

- None
- all concepts will be explained
- Helpful are 
    + quantitative genetics
    + statistics
    + linear algebra
    + R
    

## Exercises

- Topics of each lecture are repeated in exercise
- Exercise hours can be used to work on problems
- Solutions are presented one week later
- Exercise platform: http://r4tea.rteastem.org:8787

## Your experiences

- Do you know any programming languages, if yes which one?
- What tools are you using when you work with data (projects, BSc thesis, MSc thesis)
- Were there any lectures in which you got in contact with programming languages, which ones?
- Are you interested in learning how to program?


## Introduction to Livestock Breeding
- Terminology
     + Livestock breeding
     + Animal breeding
     + Ambiguous use
     
- History
    + Traditional breeding
    + Genomics
    

## Fundamental Questions
- What is the best animal?
- How to find it?

```{r bestanimal, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/bestanimal.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/bestanimal.png")
```

     
## Phenotypes and Genotypes

$$
P = G + E
$$

where $P$ and $E$ are observed and $G$ is unknown


## Improving Animal Populations
- Improvement via breeding $\rightarrow$ long-term
- Two tools

1. selection
    + process to determine parents of next generation
    + natural selection in wildlife and livestock
    + artificial selection in livestock: fix a goal and rank
2. mating
    + which animal is bred to which
    + extreme
    + complementary
    + heterosis - crossbreeding


## Statistics

- BLUP
- Bayesian methods


## Computer Science

- Methods have been developed in 1940's - 1950's
- Progress occured later
- Development of cheap computing power


## Milk Yield

```{r milkcompperf, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.cap="Yearly Milk Yield per Cow in the USA"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/milkcompperf.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/milkcompperf.png")
```


## Computer Performance
```{r moorelaw, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.cap="Computing Performance According To Moore's Law"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/moorelaw.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/moorelaw.png")
```
