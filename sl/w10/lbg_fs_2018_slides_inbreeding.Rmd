## Inverse of $A$ Based on $L$ and $D$

* Matrix $A$ was decomposed into $A = L \cdot D \cdot L^T$
* Get $A^{-1}$ as $A^{-1} = (L^T)^{-1} D^{-1} L^{-1}$
* $D^{-1}$ is diagonal again with elements

$$(D^{-1})_{ii} = 1/(D)_{ii}$$

## Inverse of $L$

* Compute $m$ based on the two decompositions of $a$

$$a = P \cdot a + m \quad \text{and} \quad a = L \cdot m$$

* Solve both for $m$ and set them equal

$$m = a - P \cdot a = (I-P)\cdot a \quad \text{and} \quad m = L^{-1} \cdot a$$

$$(I-P) \cdot a = L^{-1} \cdot a$$
and

$$L^{-1} = I-P$$
